\section{Introduction}
To verify the functionality of the ALU unit, the VHDL code is tested using Verilog Simulation process. The implementation of the ALU consists of the entity and an architecture.\\
For verification a so called \textit{testbench} is designed. The testbench creates a new unit of the ALU the \textit{Unit under test (UUT)}.

\section{UUT}
The UUT represents a unit of the ALU and following test procedure is performed:\\

\begin{minted}{vhdl}
        -- set input signal
        wait for 100ns;
        in_a <= "00000000000000000000000000000010";
        in_b <= "00000000000000000000000001000000";

        -- set op signal
        alu_op <= "0000";
        wait for 100ns;
        alu_op <= "0001";
        wait for 100ns;
        alu_op <= "0010";
        wait for 100ns;
        alu_op <= "0011";
        wait for 100ns;
        alu_op <= "0100";
        wait for 100ns;
        alu_op <= "0101";
        wait for 100ns;
        alu_op <= "0110";
        wait for 100ns;
        alu_op <= "0111";
        wait for 100ns;
        alu_op <= "1000";
        wait for 100ns;
        alu_op <= "1001";
        wait for 100ns;
        alu_op <= "1010";
        wait for 100ns;
        alu_op <= "1011";
        wait for 100ns;
        alu_op <= "1100";
        wait for 100ns;
        alu_op <= "1101";
        wait for 100ns;
