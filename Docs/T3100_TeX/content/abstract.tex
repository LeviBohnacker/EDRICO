\begin{abstract}
EDRICO is a project executed by two electrical engineering students at the DHBW Ravensburg. In the very fast evolving technical world, it is important to keep up with new and upcoming technology. RISC-V is a modern open source ISA gaining a lot of popularity not only from the open-source community but also from international companies.
This project combines theoretical knowledge from lectures and research that has to be done during the course of the project. The tasks and challenges in this project will result in a deep understanding of FPGA, HDL and RISC-V as well as general computer theory, hardware design and processor technology.
