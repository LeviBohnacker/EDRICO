\chapter{Motivation}

RISC-V was first proposed at Berkeley University in 2010. The architecture is
therefore relatively new in comparison to others like x86, ARM or SPARC. Even
though its young age is already very promising, every year new breakthroughs are
achieved in the field of RISC-V based cores.
MicroMagic for example announced in 2020 a chip with a total CoreMark score of
13000 and an incredible 110000 Coremark/Watt. This poses a significant
development and is approximately 10 times better than any CISC, RISC or MIPS
implementation in terms of Performance per Watt.
Many other companies like Alibaba, Nvidia and SiFive are currently increasing
research on RISC-V based cores.
The Motivation behind this project was to gain experience in processor and \ac{FPGA}
design and verification. Furthermore it poses an interesting opportunity for students
to work on a new and upcoming processor architecture.
